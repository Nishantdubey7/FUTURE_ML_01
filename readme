## 🔍 Project Overview

Sales forecasting is a crucial Machine Learning application used by organizations to make informed decisions.  
Accurate forecasts help businesses to:

- Plan inventory effectively  
- Manage cash flow  
- Optimize workforce planning  
- Minimize losses due to overstocking or understocking  

This project focuses on applying Machine Learning to **solve real-world business problems**, not just training models.

## 📁 Dataset

**Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting (Kaggle)**  
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting  

> The dataset is not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.  
> Please download the `train.csv` file from Kaggle and place it in the project directory before running the code.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Load and preprocess historical sales data  
2. Aggregate sales data into a time series format  
3. Handle missing values and dates  
4. Train a time-series forecasting model  
5. Evaluate model performance using error metrics  
6. Visualize historical sales and future forecasts  

---

## 📊 Outputs

- Sales forecast visualizations  
- Future sales predictions saved as a CSV file  
- Model evaluation metrics (MSE, MAPE)  

All outputs are designed to be **easy to interpret by non-technical stakeholders**.
